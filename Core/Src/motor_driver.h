 *
 * @brief An implementation of a motor driver using a struct to emulate
 * Object Oriented Programming.  The motor has 4 parameters, timer which
 * indicates the timer to be used to run the motor, channels, which indicates
 * the channels to be used to run the motor, duty_cycle, the duty cycle to
 * run the motor at, and enable_flag, which determines if the motor is
 * allowed to run
 *
 * @param timer The microcontroller timer to use to control the pwm in the motor.  This is a timer pointer.
 * @param channels The channels the PWM signal should run on.  1 corresponds to 1 and 2, and 2 corresponds to 3 and 4.
 * @param duty_cycle The duty cycle of the motor from -ARR to ARR, which is 1000
 * @param enable_flag The flag which indicates whether or not the motor should be allowed to run.  A zero means the motor is disabled and a one means the motor is enabled.
