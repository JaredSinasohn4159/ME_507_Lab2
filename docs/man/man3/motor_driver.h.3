The motor has 4 parameters, timer which indicates the timer to be used to run the motor, channels, which indicates the channels to be used to run the motor, duty_cycle, the duty cycle to run the motor at, and enable_flag, which determines if the motor is allowed to run\&.

.SS "void motor_enable_disable (\fBMotor\fP * motor, uint8_t enable)"
Enables or disables motor based on user input
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fImotor,the\fP \fBMotor\fP struct to act upon 
.br
\fIenable,the\fP boolean of whether to enable or disable the motor with 1 being to enable and 0 being to disable\&. 
.RE
.PP
if user wants to enable motor
.PP
First retrieve ARR to set motor to brake mode
.PP
Now set the correct motor pair to brake mode\&.
.PP
set the motor's enable flag to 1
.PP
if user wants to disable motor
.PP
set the motor's enable flag to 0
.SS "void motor_set_duty_cycle (\fBMotor\fP * motor, int32_t doot)"
This function implements the duty cycle setting of the motor\&. It takes in the motor struct and a duty cycle from -100 to 100 (though the function saturates values above and below these values)/\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fImotor,the\fP \fBMotor\fP struct to be operated on\&. 
.br
\fIdoot,the\fP duty cycle to be set to\&. 
.RE
.PP
First, check if the motor is disabled
.PP
if the enable flag isn't set exit the function and do nothing\&. we are also using != 1 so if there is a stray value in memory, the motor doesn't accidentally enable\&.
.PP
Next, saturate the duty cycle just in case\&.
.PP
We need to get the auto reload value for the timer we are using signed value so we don't run into sign issues later
.PP
Now calculate the duty cycle in terms of the CCR value
.PP
now we need to set the motors to the correct duty cycles Forwards will be channels 1 and 3 for motors 1 and 2 respectively Backwards will be channels 2 and 4 for motors 1 and 2 respectively
.PP
the below CCR's are based on the logic table of the toshiba, setting motor\&. to brake mode if duty cycle is <0
.PP
if duty cycle >=0
